### 2. **Flutter Project Structure**
A complete Flutter application skeleton with:

#### Models
- **device.dart**: Device model with states (on/off, brightness, fan speed, temperature)
- **room.dart**: Room model with device lists and energy calculations

#### Providers (State Management)
- **room_provider.dart**: Manages rooms, devices, and room favorites
- **device_provider.dart**: Handles device control operations (toggle, brightness, fan speed, temperature)
- **automation_provider.dart**: Manages automation routines, scenes, and smart modes

#### Screens
- **home_screen.dart**: Main dashboard with room grid
- **automation_screen.dart**: Automation management and quick scenes, stats, and navigation

#### Configuration
- **pubspec.yaml**: All dependencies including Provider, HTTP, WebSocket, Bluetooth, MQTT
- **README.md**: Project documentation

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** pattern with:
- **Flutter** framework (Dart)
- **Provider** for state management
- **Dual connectivity**: Wi-Fi & Bluetooth Low Energy
- **Real-time updates**: WebSocket & MQTT
- **Local storage**: Hive + SharedPreferences

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Install Flutter SDK (3.0+)
2. Install Dart
3. Set up Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter extensions

### Steps to Run
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd Mobile_App

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

### First Run
The app will:
1. Load default room configurations
2. Display home screen with room grid
3. Show device statistics
4. Allow navigation to room details

## 📋 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Backend Integration
- Implement API service layer
- Set up WebSocket connection
- Configure MQTT broker
- Implement device communication protocols

### Phase 2: Device Controls
- Create device control screens
- Implement slider controls for brightness/temperature
- Add fan speed selector
- Build scene presets UI

### Phase 3: Bluetooth Integration
- Set up BLE scanning
- Implement device pairing
- Add connection status indicators
- Handle offline mode

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Implement scheduling system
- Add energy reports dashboard
- Create scene presets
- Implement geofencing

### Phase 5: Testing & Deployment
- Write unit & integration tests
- Perform security testing
- Optimize performance
- Deploy to app stores

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```dart
// Using Provider pattern
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => RoomProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => DeviceProvider()),
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(...),
)
```

### Device Control Flow
1. User taps device control
2. Provider updates local state immediately (optimistic UI)
3. API call sent to backend
4. Real-time WebSocket updates device state
5. UI reflects actual device status

### Data Models
```dart
Device {
  - id: String
  - name: String
  - type: DeviceType (light, fan, tv, ac, etc.)
  - state: DeviceState (isOn, brightness, fanSpeed, temperature)
  - isOnline: bool
  - currentLoad: double (Watts)
}

Room {
  - id: String
  - name: String
  - devices: List<Device>
  - totalLoad: calculated
  - activeDevices: calculated
}
```
